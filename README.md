### See all categories that are available along with amount of questions in that category! 
See all the categories that are available in Recognition along with the highscores that have been set in each category, see how many questions are in each category! 

### Answer questions through visual recognition
Answer all questions through a visual hint above the question! Recognize your way to a highscore in each category.

### Set and reset highscores
Get and beat the highscore in each of the categories that are locally stored, also have the opportunity to reset the highscore on all categories whenever you want to! After quiz is finished, view all the right answers.

<!-- CONCEPT PROCESS -->
<!-- Briefly explain your concept ideation process -->
<!-- here you will add things like wireframing, data structure planning, anything that shows your process. You need to include images-->
## Concept Process

The `Conceptual Process` is the set of actions, activities and research that was done when starting this project. <br>
The conceptual approach to creating this application was largely inspired by looking at other applications that were similiar, the success of the application would depend on identifying limitations that I had while pushing myself to create an application that is functional. During my process I had looked at different applications on the google playstore and other sources. The conceptual process has always proven to be difficult and an important step, especially considering that this would be my first application built using Kotlin. 
<br> 

### Ideation

### User Flow
As part of my planning for this application, a user flow Diagram was created in order to identify the possible routes that the user could take throughout the application, considering that the application does not have many routes to explore, the Diagram was kept fairly simple. The user flow diagram played a large role in the planning phase and how my visuals would look
### Wireframes
  Wireframing fell as part of my planning process, these wireframes would guide me in the right direction and would assist me in planning my content in order to ge the best possible outcan that I could possibly get for this project.

<!-- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -->
## Development Process

The `Development Process` is the technical implementations and functionality done in the frontend and backend of the application.

### Implementation Process
<!-- stipulate all of the functionality you included in the project -->
<!-- This is your time to shine, explain the technical nuances of your project, how did you achieve the final outcome!-->

* During the development of this application I had utilised Kotlin to implement functionallity for the project. XML was used for the layout of the project
* Category names are implemented dynamically through the use of a Object class file that holds all the names of the category, question ammounts are also added in dynamically by calculating the length of the current questions dataset.
* Results are showcased and created dynamically based on the amount of questions in a particular category.
* Questions , answers and iamges are populated dynamically and final score is showcased based on correct answers and length of category.
* Highscore is saved if the users final score is higher than the highscore. Users are also able to reset all high scores. 
* Visual feedback from application on every answer, if the answer is wrong visual feedback will showcase red and correct answer will showcase green

#### Highlights
<!-- stipulated the highlight you experienced with the project -->
* Over the course of this project, a definite highlight was the implementation of Kotlin and XML, learning this was challenging and yet rewarding
* Using Kotlin has taught me the basics of Android development, and although I have not implemented a huge amount of functionallity, I look forward to learning more about this language

#### Challenges
<!-- stipulated the challenges you faced with the project and why you think you faced it or how you think you'll solve it (if not solved) -->
* The largest challenge I have faced throughout this entire project was the implementation of the timer found on each questions, while the actual countdown was not too challenging, it is moving on to the next activity that has shown to be extremly challenging. (was this issue resolved?)
* Learning Kotlin was a challenge, this language has been a huge challenge considering that I am used to Javascript which follows a completely different approach when it comes to programming.

#### Above And Beyond

What aspects of this final build contribute to the `Above And Beyond` Component of your brief?
<!-- what did you learn outside of the classroom and implement into your project-->
* For the extra functionallity in this project I have implemented a timer that visually shows the user how much time they have left on the current question. When the timer has run out, the question will then be dismissed and it will move on to the next question
* Categories have been placed into the application dynamically.
* Images are shown on each question. 


### Future Implementation
<!-- stipulate functionality and improvements that can be implemented in the future. -->
*In Future I would like to improve on the UI of the application and making it more interactable, this application is fairly simple and I would like to learn more about Kotlin to make a more advanced project
* I would like to implement a backend to the application, I see a lot of potential in this application and think the implementation of something like Firebase would make this application a lot more exciting
* Another future improvement is making the application available on any Android device instead of only on mobile devices
