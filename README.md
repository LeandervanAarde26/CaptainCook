### First time user? Use the onboarding screens.
First time users get a brief overview of the applicaiton with the onboarding screens, showcasing each of the main functionallities in the application. Users that have opened the application will not see these views

### View all recipes that are available on the app, pulled from AWS! 
You can view all the recipes and their previews on the app, all data that is sitting on an AWS S3 Bucket JSON file!

### View Information about recipes in an individual recipe view
Like what you see on the previews? Tap on the recipe to get more information about the recipe like ingredients, cooking instructions and cooking time! 

### Save your favorite Recipes to Favorites
Like the recipe? Core Data has made it possible for users to save their favorite recipes into an entity to view at a later stage, delete the entity or clear all data

### Amazon S3 Buckets
Amazon S3 buckets are used to avoid data on the application

### Themes!
Users can change between light mode and dark mode in order to find what they like most! 

### Filter and Search
Looking for something specific? Users can filter all recipes and search for recipes that they want to see!

<!-- CONCEPT PROCESS -->
<!-- Briefly explain your concept ideation process -->
<!-- here you will add things like wireframing, data structure planning, anything that shows your process. You need to include images-->
## Concept Process

The `Conceptual Process` is the set of actions, activities and research that was done when starting this project.
<br>
Before creating the Wireframes and designs for this project, I had gone through a conceptual process that included looking at other apps that were native to Ios, researching aspects such as the icons that should be used in this kind of application. I had used my inspiration to create a moodboard with application styles that I would want to use. During this process I had also started to consider how the application should be structured from a UX perspective. 
<br> 

### Ideation

![image7](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=15ChgMu1cXaYxxj1qY4abotzi6e-rqXkA)
### User Flow
As part of my planning phase I had created a userflow Diagram to plan out the user journey that could take place in the application. This part of the application planning was crucial in terms of planning layout and Hierarchy in the app. 
### Wireframes
  Wireframing fell as part of my planning process, these wireframes would guide me in the right direction and would assist me in planning my content in order to ge the best possible outcome that I could possibly get for this project.

<!-- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -->
## Development Process

The `Development Process` is the technical implementations and functionality done in the frontend and backend of the application.

### Implementation Process
<!-- stipulate all of the functionality you included in the project -->
<!-- This is your time to shine, explain the technical nuances of your project, how did you achieve the final outcome!-->

* For this project I had used SwiftUI for the functionallity and layout of the project 
* Data is implemented through the use of Amazon S3 buckets, through the use of a JSON file being uploaded to my bucket.
* Core data was used for users to save , view and delete favorite recipes that have been pulled from the API
* App themes were implemented through init functions in the Setting screen that would change the app appereance and Colors based on the chosen theme.


#### Highlights
<!-- stipulated the highlight you experienced with the project -->
* One of the biggest highlights in this project was learning how to use SwiftUI and learn more about native iOS development. 
* Using Core Data has been a huge highlight, while it is stil a bit abstract to me, I do believe I grasp the basics and it has been extremly rewarding to see it work.

#### Challenges
<!-- stipulated the challenges you faced with the project and why you think you faced it or how you think you'll solve it (if not solved) -->
* Due to how I structured the project, data parsing was a large challenge, I did overcome this by being a bit repetitive in my code, and calling date more than once.
* Core data was a huge challenge, getting it to work was the largest portion of this project. I struggled to understand it and to implement it. I overcame this with one of the classes and videos that was given for homework, giving me a better understanding 

#### Above And Beyond

What aspects of this final build contribute to the `Above And Beyond` Component of your brief?
<!-- what did you learn outside of the classroom and implement into your project-->
* For extra functionallity I had implemented S3 buckets to pull data from an online source, through making a JSON I was able to pull data. I would like to implement MongoDB in the future to have users upload data as well. 
* Core data was used for favorites , giving users the ability to add , remove and clear favorites from core data
* Images are not stored locally for recipes, they are all implemented with AsyncImage


### Future Implementation
<!-- stipulate functionality and improvements that can be implemented in the future. -->
*I would like to improve the layout of the structure in this project, making it more accurate to a real project. 
* I would like to implement a backend to the application, I see a lot of potential in this application and think the implementation of something like Firebase would make this application a lot more exciting
